### Part A - Match credit score:

1. We need to implement simple logic for scoring:
   1. For **A** user credit score must to be **679** and above.
   2. For **B** user credit score must to be between **579** and **679**.
   3. For **C** user credit score must to be under **579**.
2. Add colors for score, green for A, yellow for B and red for C.

3. Find a UX solution for scoring display and implement it, remember this UI must be user friendly.
4. Our call center asked us to add credit score data to the match.

### Part B - Search and filters:

1. We are showing the last 5 matches. The rumor in the call centers says there are a lot more. Please fix this, and **remember that we’re spreading worldwide, and we will have many more matches soon. Much much more.**

2. The simple search we provide isn’t enough. We need to add an ability to search for match companies and email.

3. **[BONUS]** - Add an ability to filter matches by labels. (Decline, Possible, Open, Close)

### Part C - approve and decline functionality

1. We must add 2 buttons: Approve and Decline.
2. Approve and Decline functionality will be to hide clicked match and count how many matches are approved and decline.
